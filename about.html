            <p class="sub-heading">Short version:</p>
            
            <p>UBC BCom 2017. YVR &#8594; YYZ. Management consultant to-be. Loves to figure skate, dance, and play piano. Graduated high school in two years. Aspires to change peoples’ lives in an impactful and meaningful way (but haven’t figured out the “how” part yet). Curious and tenacious. Fan of good cheesecake. <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality">INFJ</a>.</p>
            
            <p class="sub-heading">Long(er) version:</p>
            <p>My name is Marissa. It means <i>of the sea</i>, which can be slightly ironic because I tend to pick the latter when given a choice between oceans or mountains. Luckily, I can still have both in my last few months living in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
            <p>I’m a fifth and final year business student at the UBC Sauder School of Business and will be moving to Toronto in August 2017 to start my career in management consulting once I graduate and spend some time abroad travelling in X destination.</p>
            <p>I am interested in business problems that intersect the public and social sphere and I’m currently learning more about concepts like the <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy">circular economy</a>, smart cities, urban sustainability, and design-thinking principles. </p>
            <p>My personal interests revolve around the performing arts. I used to compete in figure skating and dance and I continue to pursue both recreationally. I also play the piano, mostly classical pieces and the soundtracks to <i>Amélie</i> and <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. Outside of all of this, I practice hot yoga and love to read. One of my current favourite novels is "<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see">All the Light We Cannot See</a>" by Anthony Doerr.</p>

            <p class="heading">Work</p>
            <p>Previously, I’ve interned at Deloitte Consulting in Strategy &amp; Operations, worked at Bosa Properties reporting to the CEO, and spent two summers at PwC in Audit &amp; Assurance. During university, I studied abroad and spent an exchange semester at Sciences Po in Paris, France. Prior to UBC, I attended the <a href="https://www.vsb.bc.ca/programs/university-transition-program">University Transition Program</a>, an early college entrance program which has allowed me to graduate with a bachelor’s degree at age 19.</p>
