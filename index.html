            <p class="heading">Hi, I'm Marissa.</p>
            <p>This is my "now page". As in – what I'm up to: now.</p>
            <p>Right now I am learning how to code HTML and CSS in order to build this website. Hopefully, Javascript and Python will soon follow.</p>
            <p>During my final semester at UBC, I am working with a team of engineering and business students to develop a startup in the waste management space. We are building a system of sensors installed in waste containers to serve two purposes: 1) to detect and monitor waste levels so companies can optimize pick-up routes for their on-call customers, and 2) to help them track their assets and manage inventory. </p>
            <p>In addition to my entrepreneurial pursuits (I’m seeking other startup opportunities in Vancouver as well), I am testing for my GRE and applying for deferred admission MBA programs in the US. Rather than the GMAT, the GRE is meant to keep my other grad school options open. </p>
            <p>I’m also getting back into all the activities I’ve postponed for the past five years of undergrad, namely: figure skating, dance (jazz, salsa, & pole – tried it twice so far), and piano. This month I had a jam session with a friend who plays the cello and I would definitely be interested in doing more duo musical adventures in general. </p>
            <p>Currently, I am attempting to read for the third time "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Expectations-Wordsworth-Classics-Charles-Dickens/dp/1853260045">Great Expectations</a>" by Charles Dickens. </p>
